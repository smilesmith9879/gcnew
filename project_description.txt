AI Four-Wheel Drive Car Comprehensive Solution
March 3, 2025 â€“ Second Edition

1. Functional Overview
This solution is based on the Raspberry Pi 5, integrating the official Raspberry Pi camera, a four-wheel-drive chassis, and PCA9685 servo control, creating an AI smart car that supports web remote control, visual SLAM, autonomous navigation, and voice interaction.

Core Features
âœ… Web Control: The web-based simulated joystick controls the car's movement, while another joystick adjusts the camera gimbal angle. The camera feed is displayed in real-time.
âœ… Real-time Video Streaming: Uses WebRTC for low-latency video transmission, utilizing the Raspberry Pi Camera + libcamera.
âœ… Remote API Control: Supports remote control of the car and camera via Flask API + WebSocket.
âœ… Voice Interaction: Implements local voice recognition and interaction using Whisper + Ollama + DeepSeekR1 1.7B.
